# Single stage helical reducer gearbox
This repository contains all files and documents for the Transmission System Design Project Course at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). All drawings are done using AutoCAD Mechanical software.

The requirements are as follow:
-	Power of working shaft, P (kW): 2.5
-	Number of revolutions per minute of working shaft, n (rpm): 160
-	Service life, Lh (hours): 10000
-	Oneâ€“way rotation, works 2 shifts
